# 👋 Hi, I’m Linda — Cybersecurity Professional & AI Security Builder  
**SOC Analyst Track | AI-Enhanced Detection | Secure LLM Deployment | Future AI Security Architect**

I blend **core cybersecurity experience** with **emerging AI security practices**, building tools that defend systems against both traditional threats and new AI-driven attacks. My work combines SOC analysis, Python security automation, and secure AI/LLM design patterns.

> **Clear direction: SOC foundations today — AI Security Engineering tomorrow.**

---

# 🌟 Why I’m Pursuing AI Security  
AI is rewriting the cybersecurity landscape, creating new attack surfaces, new threat models, and entirely new behaviors we’ve never had to defend before. I’m driven by the challenge of securing intelligent systems—ensuring LLMs, agents, and automated workflows operate **safely, predictably, and securely**.

I’m pursuing AI Security because:

- It demands **creativity, engineering depth, and forward-thinking problem solving**  
- It blends classical cybersecurity with cutting-edge AI advancements  
- It protects organizations from a new generation of adversarial threats  
- It allows me to design systems that are not only secure—but *intelligently defensive*  

This path aligns with how I think, how I learn, and how I want to contribute to the future of cybersecurity.
